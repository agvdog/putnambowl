    <br>
    <p><u>Scoring</u></p>
    <br>
    <p>We will be basing Putnam Points on the Vegas money line. &nbsp; You can view the money line we will be using at Vegas Insider:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
    <br>
    <p><a href="https://www.vegasinsider.com/nfl/odds/las-vegas/money/">https://www.vegasinsider.com/nfl/odds/las-vegas/money/</a></p>
    <br>
    <p>You will receive an email each week indicating the number of Putnam Points for each team.&nbsp; As always, favorites will always be worth 1 PB point should they win.&nbsp; The number of points for the underdog will be calculated using the money line.&nbsp;</p>
    <br>
    <p>If you are interested, here&rsquo;s how the money line works.&nbsp; Take a hypothetical game between Miami and Tampa Bay, where the money line for Miami is +150 and -170 for Tampa Bay (as with the spread, + indicates underdogs and &ndash; indicates favorites).&nbsp; This means that you would have to bet $170 on Tampa Bay to win $100 and you would win $150 if you bet $100 on Miami and they won.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
    <br>
    <p>We will take the money line and convert it to PB Points.&nbsp; In the example above, Tampa Bay (and any favorite) will be worth 1 PB Point and Miami would be worth 1.58 PB Points.&nbsp; Converting this involves some math, which you don&rsquo;t need to know.&nbsp; If you are interested, however, we can send you the formula and a spreadsheet to calculate it yourself.</p>
    <p><br><br><br></p>
    <p><u>Additional Points</u></p>
    <br>
    <p><strong>&ldquo;Perfect Game&rdquo; Bonus:</strong> Correctly picking every game in a given week (regular season only) is worth 10 points in addition to all other points earned that week.</p>
    <br>
    <p>In the <u><strong>playoffs</strong></u> all points for favorites and underdogs are <strong>doubled</strong> (i.e., picking the favored team is worth 2 points if they win).&nbsp;</p>
    <br>
    <p>In the <u><strong>Superbowl</strong></u> points are <strong>quadrupled</strong> (i.e., picking the favored team is worth 4 points if they win).</p>
    <br>
    <p><u>Picking Games</u></p>
    <br>
    <p>We will send out by e-mail the upcoming week's games with their respective PB Points calculated as described above.&nbsp; <strong>Note:&nbsp; we will NOT pick Wednesday or Thursday night games, but you must pick a winner for every other game over the weekend and for the Monday night game(s), every week.</strong></p>
    <br>
    <p><strong>PLEASE SEND YOUR PICKS TO BOTH: </strong><a href="mailto:mark.r.hutchinson@gmail.com"><strong>mark.r.hutchinson@gmail.com</strong></a><strong> and </strong><a href="mailto:benjamin.a.valentino@dartmouth.edu"><strong>benjamin.a.valentino@dartmouth.edu</strong></a><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
    <br>
    <p><u>Please write "PUTNAM BOWL PICKS" in the subject line of you message so that we will know not to open it until we have made our own picks. We promise not to cheat.</u><br><br>To make this easier for all of us, please make your picks by simply cutting and pasting the list into your picks email and deleting the team you think will lose from the spread you get by email from us each week. In other words, you will be sending us a list of just the teams you think will win each game <u>in the same order as they are listed in the spread.</u> This makes scoring MUCH easier for us each week (insert your own joke here).&nbsp;</p>
    <br>
    <ul>
    <li aria-level="1"><strong>Picks for the weekend slate of games are due one hour before kick-off of the first game to be played (even if on a Saturday).&nbsp;</strong></li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <ul>
    <li aria-level="1"><strong>If we do not receive all of your picks on time for the weekend slate of games, then NONE of your picks will count, regardless of whether they are sent before their respective games. In other words, don&rsquo;t just send a pick for a Saturday game in anticipation of sending the rest of your picks later in the weekend. You will not receive credit for any picks that week.</strong>&nbsp;</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <ul>
    <li aria-level="1"><strong>If we do not receive your weekend slate picks ON TIME in any given week, you will receive a score for that week of 3 points less than the lowest score received by any other person that week. (So if the low scorer for the week gets 2 PB Points, you get minus 1).&nbsp; You will also be ridiculed in the &ldquo;Standings&rdquo; e-mail, which goes out each Tuesday.</strong>&nbsp;</li>
    </ul>
    <p><br><u>Pre-Season Picks</u></p>
    <br>
    <p>In addition to your picks for the first games of the season, <u>which will be due at <strong>NOON (EST) on SUNDAY, SEPTEMBER 13</strong></u>, you must send your predictions for the following:&nbsp;</p>
    <br>
    <ol>
    <li><u>Big Loser</u> - You must pick the team you think will end the regular season with the worst record in the NFL.&nbsp; A correct pick is worth <strong>10 points</strong> at the end of the regular season; if there is a tie among 2+ teams for worst record, the point value for correctly picking on of them is divided by the number of teams that shared the dubious distinction.&nbsp; For example, if 2 teams finish 2-14 and you picked one as your big loser, you get 5 points.</li>
    </ol>
    <br>
    <ol start="2">
    <li><u>Playoffs</u> &ndash; You must also pick the teams you think will play in the Superbowl (the NFC and AFC champions) and the Superbowl winner (which must be one of your conference champion picks).&nbsp; A correct pick for conference champ is worth <strong>5 points</strong>; a correct pick for Superbowl champ is worth <strong>10 points.</strong></li>
    </ol>
    <br>
    <ol start="3">
    <li><u>Penalties</u> - If the team you picked as your Big Loser makes the playoffs, you <strong><u>lose</u></strong><strong> 5 points</strong>.&nbsp; If a team you picked as a Conference Champion fails to make the playoffs, you <strong><u>lose</u></strong><strong> 5 points</strong> (minus 10 if both your conference champion picks do not make it).&nbsp;</li>
    </ol>
    <p>&nbsp;<br><br></p>
    <p>Good luck!</p>
    <p>The Office of The Commissioner</p>
